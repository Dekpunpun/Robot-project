"""The case. Everything the game knows about the scenario lives here.

Four suspects instead of one, each cracking under a different mechanic (see
each suspect's "break" dict): Thorne needs a pile of evidence, Doss and
Ashworth need one specific piece of evidence *plus* the right question, and
Bricker needs no evidence at all — only for the detective to have explained,
in conversation, what is actually at stake.
